My name is *Claudio Guarnieri*. I go online as **Nex**. I'm a security researcher, free software developer and artist.

I research the use of technology as a mean for repression, and provide assistance to human rights organizations, journalists, and activists with issues of computer security, privacy and surveillance. Currently, I work as a Senior Technologist and Researcher at [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org), and I'm an Adviser to the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.org), University of Toronto, and a core member of [The Honeynet Project](http://www.honeynet.org). I also founded [Security Without Borders](https://www.securitywithoutborders.org).

I created the open source malware analysis software [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://cuckoosandbox.org) and [Viper](http://viper.li) and I run the [Malwr](https://malwr.com) free service. I published abundant research on botnets and targeted attacks and presented at conferences such as *Hack In The Box*, *BlackHat*, *Chaos Communication Congress* and many more.

In recent years I devoted my attention especially to issues of privacy and surveillance and I published numerous articles on surveillance vendors such as *FinFisher* and *HackingTeam* with the [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.org/category/author/claudio-guarnieri/) as well as on NSA/GCHQ and Five Eyes surveillance capabilities with *The Intercept* and *Der Spiegel*. I am also an opinion writer and columnist and I've been published by *Die Zeit*, *Slate*, *Deutsche Welle* and *Motherboard*.

I have been selected among the [50 persons of the year 2014](http://www.wired.it/attualita/tech/2014/12/29/50-persone-wired-2014/) by *Wired Italy*, I received with the *Citizen Lab* the [EFF Pioneer Award](https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer/2015) in 2015, and I've been selected by *Forbes* among the [30 Under 30](http://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2016/enterprise-tech/) honorees for 2016.

I also play music, and create art with traditional media as well as with new and generative media. Most of my work deals with privacy, surveillance, and the digitisation of modern society. Some of it has been exhibited and published in print in Berlin and London.
