I curate a personal newsletter which I reserve for irregular thoughts that don't fit a blog post or a hot take on Twitter, and where you can find updates on my work. In this newsletter you can expect various reflections on cyber security, privacy and surveillance. You can also expect links I have found interesting, as well as books that I'm reading or updates on art projects I am working on.

<b>You can subscribe to it [here](https://newsletter.nex.sx/subscription/B1UbVz2JQ).</b> Yes, you can also receive it PGP encrypted.

<i>If you subscribe, your email address is only stored on a server I run with an open source newsletter software called [Mailtrain](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain), and it is not shared with anyone. The emails I send do not track clicks, do not carry advertisement, or otherwise attempt to invade your privacy in any possible way. Additionally, I only write plain-text emails ([disable HTML view!](https://twitter.com/botherder/status/995966058371670016)).</i>
